## Testing Some Stuff

So I heard it might be good to have a blog, _you know_, to show employers that I can think and stuff.
This is really just a test to tr y out markdown, and to see how Jekyll Works. So far I think it's working.

### Languages I know / want to learn
- **Java** - the main one I'm learning, getting the hang of it
- **Processing** - what I learnt to code in, working through the nature of code Ebook
- **C/C++** - used it for an ENGR101 project, know the basics, but still daunted by
- **Python** - Don't know it yet but feel like it'd be a good one to get under my belt

How about an image?:

Maybe some code?

```java
void method(int value){
	value++;
	System.out.println(value);
}
```

Anyway, I think that worked.
