### Re-Wedding

When I was just over 4 months old, we got married. Mum, dad, and I, wearing my blueberry hat. Today, 20 years later, nearly 20,000 km away, it's my brother's turn to be part of the wedding. 

During 2001 we were living on the small atoll of Tokelau, and that's when Quinn came into the picture. Thank-god you came when you did, who knows if we'd be living here if you didn't. Our parents given me the opportunity to experience growing up in a different culture than that I was born in, with 2 places on opposite ends of the world that I can call home. 

They entered us in a school that I still enjoy returning to, a place that I didn't dread going to in the morning, but looked forward to, which I probably wouldn't have gone to if it weren't Mum's time at Wynstones Waldorf School in England. 

My parents let us see the many corners of the world, something for which I will always be grateful, and has developed my drive to go explore it further. I'm not sure if all parents would have reacted as **positively** to my idea of riding a motorbike around Vietnam for 2 months, a trip that will stay with me for a long time.

I have you guys to thank for so much in my life, all because it wasn't enough for Mum to write an article about the Malboro-men, she needed one for herself.

I love you guys, see you soon <3
